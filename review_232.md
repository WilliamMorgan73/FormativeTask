### Review Categories
*i*. Very good. Could maybe do with some more relavent and interesting images. Lots of word-dense pages.

*ii*. Excellent. Pages look modern and there is very consistent styling. Visual presentation is very appealing. However, pages lack visual distinction and individuality. Furthermore, some images are stretched. Some hyperlinks aren't actually links. 

*iii*. Exemplary. All pages are very well written.

*iv*. Unacceptable. None of the pages are valid, with 20+ errors per page. For example, missing alt tags, unclosed tags, and stray tags.

*v*. Outstanding. Overall good amount of contributions from each member, which were all completed mostly before the deadline. Author info is detailed and links appropriately to each author's respective pages.

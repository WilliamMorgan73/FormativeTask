# Consistency and Quality of Representation
- The webpage looks beautiful, although some pages do not have imgaes on them. Additionally, the "Education" page loads quite slowly (possibly due to images), and some images are not scaled accordingly (possibly due to different length of texts). <br>
### Mark: I (90%) Exemplary

# Quality of Written Presentation
- There were some spelling mistakes which could have been avoided easily and some paragraphs could have been a bit more elaborate. <br>
### Mark: II(i) (69%) Very Good

<br>

# Validity of HTML
- The title of the "Jobs" page is still "product example for Bootstrap" and it has a broken "Coming Soon" button. The text in the paragraphs could be broken into smaller pieces for better readibility. At lines 92-94, 112-114, and 140-143  in the "Jobs" page, the closing divs are on the same level of indentation. The "Health Care" page's title is also still "product example for Bootstrap". <br>

# Evidence of Collaboration
- Some minor fixes were done last minute (relatable so no points deducted:). Quite an even distribution of colloboration. Author information not on individual pages (by others), yet we do acknowledge that you wrote bios for each other. No LinkedIn though. THe folder structure is not ideal (sub-pages and css in same director).<br>
